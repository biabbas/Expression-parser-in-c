# ExpressionTreeRE3.c
A C program to solve an infix expression using Expression Tree.
The below was the question in my lab manual.

Compilers use expression trees to represent mathematical
expressions where the leaf nodes represent the operands and the internal nodes
represent the operators. Develop a program to evaluate such an expression tree
with non-negative integers as operands.

The ExpressionTreeRE3.c file is the most updated file.
ExpressionTreeRE2.c file contains code that could solve an infix expression which has non-negative single digit(Max) integers.
ExpressionTreeRE3.c file has code that could solve an infix expression which has non-negative 10 digit(Max) integers.
